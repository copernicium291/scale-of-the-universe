This is the maximum possible scale of quantum foam determined by the European Space Agency's INTEGRAL satellite. It was determined that space is non-granular down to a scale of at most 10^-48 meters, by measurement of gamma ray polarization. (This measurement is only applicable to some theories of quantum gravity, and may not be entirely accurate.)","quantum foam2\t1.000000e-43\tQuantum Foam (Holographic Model)\t\tThis is a model of quantum gravity where the Heisenberg uncertainty principle applies to spacetime, and photons travelling long distances can acquire phase differences.

The de Broglie wavelength is the wavelength of these matter waves, and depends on the particle's mass and velocity (or momentum or kinetic energy.) For protons in the Large Hadron Collider with energies of about 6.8 TeV this wavelength is 180 zeptometers.","top quark\t7.167000e-18\tTop Quark (Compton Wavelength)\t\t\tI chose the top quark's size measurement differently than the other quarks.

(Theoretically, it would be about 50 attometers.)","higgs boson\t9.900000e-18\tHiggs Boson (Compton Wavelength)\t\tThe Higgs boson is an elementary particle. It is produced by an excitation of the Higgs field, which generates most of the mass of electrons and quarks. (Neutrinos and hadrons get mass by other mechanisms.) It is the most recently discovered elementary particle, first detected in 2011 but not confirmed to exist until 2013.","weak force\t2.720000e-17\tWeak Force Range\t\t\t\tThe distances where the weak nuclear force can affect two particles depends on the distance scales of the interaction. This is limited to about 13.6 attometers by the weak bosons having mass.

Unlike muons, tauons live for less than a millionth of a microsecond.","bottom quark\t7.700000e-16\tBotttom Quark\t\t\t\t\tThe bottom quark is the heaviest quark that can form hadrons. These hadrons actually live longer than the lighter charm quark hadrons. The reason is related to the reason that top quarks almost always decay into bottom quarks.","pion\t\t1.300000e-15\tPion\t\t\t\t\t\tPions are force carrying particles, but they are not fundamental particles. They are mesons, which carry the force that binds protons and neutrons (and all other hadrons) together. There are three types of pions: a neutral pion, a positive pion, and a negative pion. The charged pions live much longer than the neutral one.","neutron\t\t1.730000e-15\tNeutron\t\t\t\t\t\tNeutrons are neutral particles inside atoms. They stabilize atomic nuclei and are responsible for the existence of different isotopes of elements. The neutron's squared charge radius is about -0.115 femtometers, so the value given here is its magnetic radius.","proton\t\t1.700000e-15\tProton\t\t\t\t\t\tProtons are positively charged particles that are in atoms. The atomic number of an element is equal to the number of protons it its atoms' nuclei.

All are very close to the range of the nuclear force.","charm quark\t1.900000e-15\tCharm Quark\t\t\t\t\tThe charm quark is the lightest of the \"heavy\" quarks (quarks that are heavier than the quantum chromodynamics scale at around 330 MeV). Although the existence of a fourth quark was suspected soon after the quark model was proposed, it wasn't until 1970 that an explanation of the decay of the neutral kaon (down quark+strange antiquark) required the existance of the charm quark, which was discovered 4 years later.","strange quark\t2.840000e-15\tStrange Quark\t\t\t\t\tParticles with strange quarks are called \"strange particles\" because some of them live for a few nanoseconds, which is longer than most hadrons. Strange particles were discovered before the strange quark itself. When the idea of quarks was first theorized, three quarks were needed to explain all baryons and mesons: up, down, and strange. Since then, three more have been found: charm, bottom, and top.","alpha particle\t3.351000e-15\tAlpha Particle\t\t\t\t\tHelium-4 is the most common nucleus in the universe other than free protons. Main sequence stars use various processes to convert 4 hydrogen-1 nuclei into a helium-4 nucleus. Additionally, when very heavy nuclei such as uranium, thorium, radon, and curium are produced in stars, many of them decay by releasing alpha particles. Nuclear decay is the source of almost all helium on Earth.","down quark\t3.670000e-15\tDown Quark\t\t\t\t\tYou may have noticed that the up and down quarks are listed as being larger than the protons and neutrons they make up. This is not a mistake. This size is simply the wavelength of a matter wave with the mass of a quark and one third the QCD binding energy of a nucleon.","up quark\t3.700000e-15\tUp Quark\t\t\t\t\tUp quarks are one of two kinds of quarks found in atoms. Protons have two and neutrons have one. Quarks don't really have a definite size, so I've used their de Broglie wavelengths when in hadrons.","lithium7lambda\t4.190000e-15\tLithium-7-Lambda Nucleus\t\t\tLithium-7-lambda is a hypernucleus composed of 3 protons, 3 neutrons, and 1 lambda baryon. Unlike protons and neutrons with only up ad down quarks, the lambda baryon contains 1 each of up, down, and strange quarks. Lithium-7-lambda quickly decays to beryllium-7.","deuteron\t4.254000e-15\tDeuteron\t\t\t\t\tMost hydrogen in the universe is hydrogen-1, which just has a proton as its nucleus. The nucleus of hydrogen-2, or deuterium, is called a deuteron and contains a neutron in addition to the proton. Because a deuterium atom has twice the mass of a hydrogen-1 atom, hydrogen-1 and hydrogen-2 are much more chemically different than isotopes of other elements are. For example, water made with deuterium freezes at 4°C (39°F) instead of 0°C (32°F).","carbon nucleus\t4.940000e-15\tCarbon Nucleus\t\t\t\t\tCarbon-12 is a very significant nuclide in the cores of stars. Once a star runs out of hydrogen, it will collapse. If it's big enough, the compression caused by the star's gravity will heat the core enough that helium nuclei can combine in groups of three to form carbon. In stars that are still fusing hydrogen (like our sun), carbon-12 can combine with four protons and release a helium nucleus, giving another way for some stars to make helium.","oxygen nucleus\t5.400000e-15\tOxygen Nucleus\t\t\t\t\tLike electrons, protons and neutrons also fill in \"shells\" in an atom. The numbers that electrons need to fill shells are 2,10,18,36,54,86,118. For protons and neutrons the numbers are 2,8,20,28,50,82,126. Nuclei with these \"magic numbers\" of protons and/or neutrons are typically much more stable than expected. The fully stable nuclei with both proton and neutron shells filled are helium-4, oxygen-16, calcium-40, calcium-48, and lead-208.","lithium-11\t6.300000e-15\tLithium-11 Nucleus\t\t\t\tThe lithium-11 nucleus has 3 protons and 8 neutrons, 4 more neutrons than the more common and stable lithium-7. It lasts for about 0.01 seconds, over 1 quintillion times longer than lithium-10 or lithium-12. This is because 2 of its neutrons are in a \"nuclear halo\". Its nucleus has a core of 3 protons and 6 neutrons, surrounded by 2 halo neutrons.","sulfur nucleus\t6.520000e-15\tSulfur Nucleus\t\t\t\t\tSulfur-32 is one of the isotopes produced by the alpha process in large stars. Carbon-12 nuclei repeatedly fuse with helium-4 nuclei until they reach nickel-56 or zinc-60. Sulfur-32 is formed by fusion of silicon-28 and helium-4. It is also produced from the fusion of two oxygen-16 nuclei.","iron nucleus\t7.480000e-15\tIron Nucleus\t\t\t\t\tIt's not actually true that the stellar fusion process ends at iron-56. Firstly, the iron actually comes from the decay of nickel-56 after the star has already exploded. Secondly, it's not even true that the fusion of nickel-56 consumes energy. Nickel-56 very commonly fuses into zinc-60, and the chain can theoretically continue for several more elements. However, the star's core is so hot that high-energy gamma rays typically destroy any nuclei heavier than nickel.","tin nucleus\t9.300000e-15\tTin Nucleus\t\t\t\t\tTin has more stable isotopes than any other element. The nucleus shown here is for tin-120, but there are nine other stable tin isotopes.","barn\t\t1.000000e-14\tBarn\t\t\t\t\t\tA barn is a unit of area equal to 10^-28 m^2. It's about the cross-sectional area of a uranium nucleus. It was created during the Manhattan Project to describe how likely two nuclei are to interact. Millibarns, microbars, and even smaller units are sometimes used. The lowest cross section of a successful fusion reaction was the synthesis of the element nihonium in 2004.","lead nucleus\t1.100000e-14\tLead Nucleus\t\t\t\t\tLead-208 is the heaviest atomic nucleus not known to decay.

Several muons pass through (or collide with) your body every second.","uranium nucleus\t1.170000e-14\tUranium Nucleus\t\t\t\t\tUranium is the heaviest element in the universe with a half-life over 100 million years. Very small amounts of heavier elements exist, but they have much shorter lifetimes.","oganesson-294\t1.300000e-14\tOganesson Nucleus\t\t\t\tOganesson-294 is the heaviest confirmed nucleus. A nucleus of unbinilium-299 (and its decay product oganesson-295) may have been detected in 2011, but it is still unknown if it was actually produced, so oganesson-294 remains the heaviest nucleus discovered for now.","super neutrino\t1.000000e-13\tSupernova Neutrino\t\t\t\tA supernova is the explosion of a massive star at the end of its life.","muonic hydrogen\t2.559277e-13\tMuonic Hydrogen Atom\t\t\t\tMuons are about 207 times heavier than electrons.

This is the approximate wavelength of the X-rays used for medical X-ray imaging.","helium atom\t6.200000e-11\tHelium Atom\t\t\t\t\tHelium atoms are the smallest atoms, but they usually don't get closer than several times this distance. This is because while the electrons are typically close to the nucleus, the atoms are far apart. If that measurement was used here, this atom would be more than 4 times larger than this.","oxygen atom\t9.600000e-11\tOxygen Atom\t\t\t\t\tThe oxygen atom is the fourth smallest atom. It is one of the most reactive chemical elements, which is why it is found in diatomic molecules rather than as single atoms.","hydrogen atom\t1.058926e-10\tHydrogen Atom\t\t\t\t\tHydrogen is the simplest atom, consisting of a nucleus (typically just a proton) and one electron. This makes it the only atom with a radius that is calculated from fundamental properties of physics/electrons without needing to measure it.","carbon atom\t1.340000e-10\tCarbon Atom\t\t\t\t\tCarbon is one of the elements required for all life on Earth. This is due to many reasons, such as being the fourth most common element in the universe, being able to form bonds with various elements in many ways, and its tendency to form long polymers.","argon atom\t1.420000e-10\tArgon Atom\t\t\t\t\tArgon is the most abundant component in Earth's air other than nitrogen and oxygen. It's been slowly created by the slight radioactivity of potassium-40 over the last 4 billion years, and now comprises about 1% of air. Because it was created by radioactive decay, Earth's argon (and the argon on similar planets like Mars) is about 11% heavier than the argon found in the rest of the universe.","positronium\t2.116709e-10\tPositronium Atom\t\t\t\tThe positive charge in a hydrogen atom doesn't necessarily have to be a proton. It could be an antimuon, a charged pion, a lambda+ baryon, or in this case a positron, the antimatter counterpart of the electron. Unlike those other examples, positrons don't decay into other particles over time, but they do annihilate with electrons, giving positronium a short lifetime of under a millionth of a second.","silicon atom\t2.220000e-10\tSilicon Atom\t\t\t\t\tSilicon is like carbon in that its atoms typically form 4 bonds, but differs in silicon being more metallic, making silicon-based life much less likely to exist than carbon-based life.","lithium atom\t2.340000e-10\tLithium Atom\t\t\t\t\tAlkali metal atoms are very large.

Silver does absorb ultraviolet light though, so it may not be gray to some animals.","water molecule\t2.750000e-10\tWater Molecule\t\t\t\t\tI should probably mention that the sizes for molecules here are differently determined than for the atoms. The atomic radii are determined by typical distances from the outer electrons to the nucleus, but the molecule sizes are defined in a way closer to the normal meaning, even though small molecules like water don't have very well defined sizes.","magnesium atom\t2.900000e-10\tMagnesium Atom\t\t\t\t\tMagnesium is the most common alkaline element in Earth's crust. This is partially the reason it's so abundant in biology, bbeing necessary for the function of many compounds, such as the chlorophyll that allows plants to do photosynthesis, the enzymes that allow muscles to function in humans, and even binds to the ATP that provides all known organisms with energy.","o2 molecule\t2.900000e-10\tOxygen Molecule\t\t\t\t\tOxygen is the second most common gas in Earth's atmosphere. Oxygen is constantly being replenished by photosynthesis and being removed by respiration. If there is too much oxygen, oxygen won't be produced much and oxygen levels go down. If there isn't enough, oxygen won't be consumed much and oxygen levels go up. These two effects balance each other keeping Earth's air at 21% oxygen.","n2 molecule\t3.050000e-10\tNitrogen Molecule\t\t\t\tNitrogen is the most common molecule in Earth's atmosphere. More than 3/4 of the atmospere is nitrogen. It's commonly used as an inert gas when noble gases such as argon can't be used. Its stability comes from the triple bond between the nitrogen atoms.","h electron\t3.326000e-10\tHydrogen Electron\t\t\t\tIn a hydrogen atom, the electron has 13.6 eV of kinetic energy giving it a de Broglie wavelength of about 333 pm.

This can form a calcium ion, which, along with sodium and potassium ions, are some of the most important ions in biology. In addition to their structural role, bones are also a storage mechanism for calcium. If you have excess calcium in your blood, it gets added to your bones. If you don't have enough calcium, your bones will release some.","potassium atom\t4.860000e-10\tPotassium Atom\t\t\t\t\tPotassium is an alkali metal, its atoms having 1 electron in their outer shells.

This one uses fullerenes as wheels, and yes, it is actually diagonal.","albumin\t\t4.200000e-9\tHuman Serum Albumin Molecule\t\t\tSerum albumin is in your blood. As one of the major constituents of blood plasma, it performs many functions, mainly transporting compounds such as hormones, fatty acids, and medications, among other things.","quantum dot\t5.000000e-9\tQuantum Dot\t\t\t\t\tA quantum dot is a particle a few nanometers in size with properties of semiconductors. Their size and shape can be altered to make them emit a specific wavelength of visible light.","helium dimer\t5.500000e-9\tHelium Dimer\t\t\t\t\tAlthough helium atoms usually do not bond, they are very weakly attracted to each other. At very low temperatures (less than 0.001 kelvins), helium atoms can form stable states known as dimers where two helium atoms stay about 5 nanometers apart. If any more than 0.1 microelectronvolts of energy is added, the helium atoms will separate and return to being monoatomic.","haemoglobin\t5.500000e-9\tHaemoglobin Molecule\t\t\t\tHaemoglobin is a protein that makes up almost the entirety of a red blood cell (excluding the 60% that is water). It allows blood in mammals to carry 70 times as much oxygen as it could without haemoglobin. A haemoglobin protein contains 4 smaller proteins called heme proteins. Each heme protein can carry 1 oxygen molecule.","antibody\t1.000000e-8\tAntibody\t\t\t\t\tAntibodies are proteins used by the immune system to identify things that shouldn't be in your body. This can include pathogens, but also can include certain other things. Autoimmune disorders can cause the body's immune system to produce antibodies against its own cells.","nak pump\t1.400000e-8\tNa-K Pump\t\t\t\t\tThis ion pump allows a cell to remove 3 sodium ions from itself and take in 2 potassium ions, by using the energy of 1 ATP molecule. A large portion of your cells' energy is used in these, especially in your brain. The movement of ions is what allows neurons (brain cells) to work.","porcine\t\t1.700000e-8\tPorcine Circovirus\t\t\t\tPorcine circoviruses are the smallest known viruses, with genomes that are less than 1800 base pairs long. They infect pigs.","transistor\t1.700000e-8\tTransistor Gate\t\t\t\t\tThe current (2023) transistors are called \"3 nm\" transistors. If you understand the concept of numbers, you might notice that they are bigger than 3 nm. The names for transistors are actually just decreasing at a constant rate. Ten years ago (2013), the 22 nm transistors commonly produced had a length of about 25 nm. At the current rate, the transistors will mislead you to believe they are smaller than atoms in another ten years.","parvovirus\t2.500000e-8\tParvovirus\t\t\t\t\tThe parvovirus, one of the smallest human viruses, has an icosahedral shape not pictured in this cross section. That shape is actually very common among viruses.","ribosome\t3.000000e-8\tRibosome\t\t\t\t\tRibosomes are found in all cells, and some organelles like mitochondria. They read RNA to generate proteins. They are also partially made of RNA. There are different types of ribosomes. This is the one found in eukaryotes like animals.","rhinovirus\t3.000000e-8\tRhinovirus\t\t\t\t\tRhinoviruses are the most common viruses that cause colds. Colds are more common during winter, and air is cold during winter, which could be the reason for the name. The reason for the name rhinovirus is because the prefix \"rhino-\" comes from an ancient Greek word meaning \"of the nose\" and it ends with \"virus\" because it is a virus. The name rhinovirus literally means \"virus of the nose\".","hepatitis\t4.200000e-8\tHeptatitis B Virus\t\t\t\tHepatitis B is an infectious disease that mainly attacks the human liver. It is spread by exposure to body fluids.

Some adenoviruses don't infect humans but instead infect other vertebrates.","flu\t\t1.000000e-7\tInfluenza Virus\t\t\t\t\tInfluenza is another name for the flu. There have been many flu pandemics in history. One of the largest, the Spanish flu, didn't actually start in Spain, but many of the reports of it were from Spain since most other countries were fighting in World War I at the time. Now, a few hundred million people get infected by influenza each year, but much fewer people actually die from it.","hiv\t\t1.200000e-7\tHuman Immunodeficiency Virus\t\t\tHuman Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is the virus that causes Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), which causes failure of the immune system, which allows other infections to be much worse or even cause death.

If viruses are alive, then bacteriophages are the most common living things.","ultraviolet\t3.000000e-7\tUltraviolet Light\t\t\t\tThe near ultraviolet light is visible to some animals, unlike the shorter wavelength ultraviolet light, which is absorbed by the atmosphere. Humans cannot see the light directly, but it makes up a portion of sunlight.","smallpox\t3.000000e-7\tSmallpox Virus\t\t\t\t\tSmallpox was a disease that infected humans. I am using the past tense here because it is the only disease to be completely eradiacated. There are 0 people with smallpox today. The last known case of smallpox was in 1978 from smallpox viruses grown in a laboratory, and the last natural case was in 1977. There are currently two places that still have smallpox, one in Russia, and one in the United State.","trilobite\t4.000000e-7\tTrilobite Molecule\t\t\t\tWhen an electron is at a very high energy level in an atom, it occupies a larger orbital. In alkali metals, this atom can form a very large molecule, such as these rubidium molecules, which are polar despite both atoms being the same element.","nanoarchaeum\t4.000000e-7\tNanoarchaeum equitans\t\t\t\tNanoarchaeum equitans is one of the smallest living organisms. It lives inside the cells of another species of archaea, and cannot live outside. They both live in near-boiling waters next to hydrothermal vents at the bottom of the ocean.","violet light\t4.200000e-7\tViolet Light\t\t\t\t\tViolet light, or blue light, has the shortest wavelength in the visible spectrum. The eye's lens filters out any wavelengths shorter than 380 nm. In people without a lens in their eye, vision is possible down to 310 nm (appearing as blue), but the rest of the eye (and the air in front of it) absorb shorter wavelengths.","melanosome\t5.000000e-7\tMelanosome\t\t\t\t\tMelanosomes are found in almost all animals. They create and store melanin, which is a pigment that gives some animals their colors. Some animals have different types of melanin. In humans, melanin causes the colors of skin, hair, and (partially) eyes.","green light\t5.100000e-7\tGreen Light\t\t\t\t\tHuman eyes are most sensitive to green light. Problems with the green cone cells in human eyes are the most common cause of colorblindness.","mycoplasma\t6.000000e-7\tMycoplasma genitalium\t\t\t\tMycoplasma genitalium is an infectious bacteria that infects humans. It has a genome of only 580 thousand base pairs. For comparison, the human genome has over 3 billion base pairs.

Thousands of years ago, clay was one of the first things humans used for writing. When it is wet, it is very easy to shape, but when it is dry it is not. It can also be used to make bricks. Many parts of some buildings are made from clay.","lysosome\t1.000000e-6\tLysosome\t\t\t\t\tLysosomes are organelles found in animal cells. They break down various molecules using enzymes in their acidic insides.","pandoravirus\t1.000000e-6\tPandoravirus\t\t\t\t\tPandoravirus is a giant virus, and has the largest genome of any known virus. It was also previously the physically largest known virus, but that is now the pithovirus. When pandoraviruses were originally discovered, they were mistaken for bacteria.","pithovirus\t1.500000e-6\tPithovirus\t\t\t\t\tPithovirus is a very large virus. It infects amoebae, which are very large cells. Rather than putting its DNA in its host's nucleus, it can actually make its own RNA. It still needs the amoeba to make the proteins, so it's technically not a living organism.","mitochondrion\t2.000000e-6\tMitochondrion\t\t\t\t\tMitochondria are organelles in a cell that take the energy out of glucose molecules and put it into a much more useful form by basically just attaching phosphate ions to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) molecules to make adenosine triphosphate (ATP). When the cell needs this energy, it can easily remove a phosphate to release it. It's actually very hard to know what the size or shape of a mitochondrion is because they vary not only between species, but even within an individual cell. I could've put 1 µm, or 4 µm, or even 10 µm and still been entirely correct.","e coli\t\t2.000000e-6\tEscherichia coli\t\t\t\tSome strains of E. coli can cause infections, but most are harmless. You have a lot of E. coli bacteria inside of you. You've probably had them since the first few days of your life. As one of the first bacteria to colonize the human gut, it helps develop the microbiome for some other bacteria to live.","chromosome 21\t2.000000e-6\tChromosome 21\t\t\t\t\tChromosome 21 is the shortest chromosome in the human genome. Having three copies of it causes Down sydrome, the most common genetic disorder involving extra/missing chromosomes.","yeast\t\t4.000000e-6\tYeast Cell\t\t\t\t\tYeast is a type of single-celled fungus used for many things such as baking and fermenting sugars. Some yeast cells are much bigger, but most are small.","cell nucleus\t6.000000e-6\tCell Nucleus\t\t\t\t\tThe cell nucleus is where DNA is stored. Specifically, this is a human cell nucleus. Other cells have different sized nuclei. Amoebae have very large nuclei, which are sometimes shaped like red blood cells, although nuclei usually don't stay as one specific shape.","chloroplast\t6.000000e-6\tChloroplast\t\t\t\t\tThe mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell. Oh wait no wrong description. The chloroplasts is not the powerhouse of the cell, but like mitochondria, they evolved from separate organisms that entered a larger cell. Chloroplasts are what does photosynthesis.","redbloodcell\t7.000000e-6\tRed Blood Cell\t\t\t\t\tMammal red blood cells (including humans) are different from those of other animals in that they have no nucleus. 85% of your cells are red blood cells, and another 5-6% also have no nucleus. That means only about 1/10 of your cells have DNA.","infrared\t9.400000e-6\tHuman Body Infrared Wavelength\t\t\tThe human body emits \"infrared\" light with a longer wavelength than visible light, similarly to how much hotter objects emit visible light. Infrared light can be used to measure the temperature of things without directly touching them.","chromosome 1\t1.000000e-5\tChromosome 1\t\t\t\t\tA chromosome is a collection of DNA found in cells, especially during cell division. Most humans have two copies of each chromosome 1-22, and also an X chromosome and another X or a Y chromosome. Chromosome 1 is the longest chromosome in the human genome. Also, chromosomes aren't naturally purple, but sometimes in laboratories they are stained purple for various reasons.","mist\t\t1.000000e-5\tMist Dorplet\t\t\t\t\tThat was supposed to say \"Mist Droplet,\" but unfortunately I mist-yped.","whitebloodcell\t1.200000e-5\tWhite Blood Cell\t\t\t\tWhite blood cells are cells found in human blood which help prevent and stop infections. They are bigger and more complex than the more common red blood cells, and have many types, which all perform different functions.","heavy neutrino\t2.300000e-5\tNeutrino (Compton Wavelength, Heaviest)\t\tThere are three kinds of neutrinos, each with a different mass. The lighter 2 masses aren't very well known, so this is a \"wavelength\" for the heaviest one. (The other two have longer wavelengths.)","pollen\t\t2.500000e-5\tPollen Grain\t\t\t\t\tPollen grain size varies widely between species. It can range from a few micrometers to nearly a millimeter. This one is a sunflower pollen grain.","skin cell\t3.000000e-5\tHuman Skin Cell\t\t\t\t\tThe outermost layer of skin is made of dead cells. This helps prevent infections because dead things cannot get infections. The rest of the skin is also important for various things such as protection from ultraviolet light, keeping your organs with the rest of your body, and making your insides be wet and not dry.","cone cell\t5.000000e-5\tCone Cell\t\t\t\t\tCone cells are the cells in the eye that detect color. Humans have three types: short (red), medium (green), and long (blue). Some animals only have two types, and others have four types. Additionally, colorblindness can be cause by a deficiency or absence of one or more cone types.","sperm\t\t6.000000e-5\tHuman Sperm Cell\t\t\t\tSperm cells are one of the two cells needed for many animals and plants to reproduce. The other is the ovum, or egg cell. The head of the sperm cell is only about 5 µm long, and almost all of its space is taken up by the nucleus. This is because the sperm cell's only purpose is to fuse itself with an egg cell.","\t\t9.000000e-5\tHuman Hair Width\t\t\t\tHuman hair varies from less than 40 µm to over 120 µm. Factors that can influence hair width include age, race, and certain hormones. People of East Asian or Native American descent usually have thicker hairs than people of African or European descent.","dust\t\t1.000000e-4\tDust Particle\t\t\t\t\tDust is made from small particles.

Dust can sometimes be visible in bright lights, such as near a window during certain times of the day.","ovum\t\t1.200000e-4\tHuman Ovum\t\t\t\t\tThe ovum is also known as the egg cell. Sperm cells can put their DNA inside egg cells to form a zygote, which will grow into an entire animal. Some animals, like fish, remove the zygotes from their body. Others, like reptiles, birds, platypuses, and echidnas, put the zygote inside a shell known as an egg. Other mammals, including humans, let the zygote grow inside of them instead of in an egg.","highdrogen\t1.500000e-4\tHydrogen Atom (n=1200)\t\t\t\tWhen the electron in a hydrogen atom is given enough energy, it can move to the second electron shell. With even more it can move to the third. Some atoms can have electrons past the hundredth energy level. When artificially created, these atoms must be kept away from any other matter that could give the electron enough energy to escape the atom, but in interstellar space they can form naturally due to the lack of other atoms. The most energetic electrons are around the 1200th electron shell.","paramecium\t2.000000e-4\tParamecium\t\t\t\t\tParamecia are unicellular aquatic organisms that have been very extensively studied.

It has a temperature of 2.725 Kelvins, which gives it a peak wavelength (most common photon wavelength) of 1063 µm. When it was created, it would have been orange light, but the expansion of the universe has shifted it into the microwave range.","flea\t\t1.500000e-3\tFlea\t\t\t\t\t\tFleas are parasitic insects that are commonly found consuming blood from mammals. A disease carried by fleas was the cause of the Black Death, which killed over 100 million people.","chaos amoeba\t2.000000e-3\tChaos carolinensis\t\t\t\tChaos carolinensis is a species of amoeba. Unlike Amoeba proteus, these ones can get much bigger because of their multiple nuclei. They're commonly used as amoebae to view with a microscope. I've seen one before, but it was an unusually large one and wouldn't fit under a microscope.","snow\t\t3.000000e-3\tSnowflake\t\t\t\t\tSnow is composed of small ice crystals with approximate rotational symmetry. No two snowflakes are identical. That's not actually unique to snowflakes, it's true for nearly any object. Apples are also not perfectly identical.","sesame seed\t3.000000e-3\tSesame Seed\t\t\t\t\tSesame seeds come from the fruits of sesame plants. When the sesame fruit is mature, it splits open to release its seeds, which can decrease production of sesame seeds.","fire ant\t4.000000e-3\tAnt\t\t\t\t\t\tThere are many different species of ants on all continents except Antarctica. There are an estimated 10^16 ants in total, which is over 1 million times the amount of humans. If humans and ants were to go to war with each other, you would have to fight a million ants. Fortunately, it seems ants do not want to do this.","12pt\t\t4.223000e-3\t12 point Text\t\t\t\t\tThe numbers on font sizes aren't arbitrary. They're actually a measurement unit. The size of 1 point has historically had many values, but today it is standardized as 1/72 of an inch. That means text in a 12-point font has a height of 1/6 inch.","rice\t\t6.000000e-3\tRice Grain\t\t\t\t\tIn 2008, the price of rice grew by more than twice, which was not nice, but sufficed. Grains of rice are larger than lice but smaller than dice. Rice can be eaten by mice. My concise advice is that a device to slice rice would not entice anyone. Rice production contributes to the melting of the polar ice. Also did you know that vice, spice, thrice, and splice all rhyme with rice?","sound sample\t7.150000e-3\tSound Sample (48 kHz)\t\t\t\tSound is caused by air pressure varying over time. A sound can be approximately recorded by measuring air pressure thousands of times per second and then played by vibrating the air to create an air pressure wave that approximates the original sound. Althought it's only accurate to 0.7-0.8 cm (depending of the frequency), sound moves very fast, so it's actually accurate to less than 0.00003 seconds.","t magnifica\t1.000000e-2\tThiomargarita magnifica\t\t\t\tThiomargarita magnifica is the largest known species of bacteria.

The term can also refer to the combination of England, Scotland, and Wales: the mainland of the United Kingdom, which the demonym \"British\" can apply to. But British can also refer to just the island of Great Britain, the UK minus Northern Ireland, and probably other things. Also, the UK's largest subdivisions are called countries, which definitely doesn't help the rest of the terminology problem.","tethys\t\t1.076800e+6\tTethys\t\t\t\t\t\tTethys, a moon of Saturn, has the lowest density of any rounded object in the solar system other than Saturn. It has a very bright surface composed almost entirely of ice, with very little rock. One half of the surface is noticably darker than the other half due to interaction with Saturn's rings.","cuba\t\t1.093000e+6\tCuba\t\t\t\t\t\tCuba is the largest island in the Carribean.

Because of how unexplored Uranus and its moons are, these descriptions have to discuss their names instead of their physical features. Hopefully we'll know more in about 25 years.","umbriel\t\t1.199000e+6\tUmbriel\t\t\t\t\t\tUmbriel is the third-largest moon of Uranus. Considering that the Latin word \"umbra\" means \"shadow\", its name is very appropriate for the darkest moon of Uranus, but it's probably a coincidence.","charon\t\t1.212000e+6\tCharon\t\t\t\t\t\tCharon is the largest moon of Pluto. It's large enough that Pluto and Charon orbit a point outside either body. Some people consider Pluto-Charon to be a double dwarf planet. Unlike Pluto, Charon has little nitrogen and methane on its surface and has no detectable atmosphere. If it does have any atmosphere, it's likely gases that escaped from Pluto and got gravitationally attracted toward Charon.","texas\t\t1.240000e+6\tTexas\t\t\t\t\t\tTexas is the second largest state in the United States.

That's because it has a lot of methane ice and organic compounds called tholins on its surface. Makemake also has a slow rotation compared to other Kuiper belt objects, with a rotation period near 23 hours. This could be due to gravitational influence from its unnamed moon, such as what happens with Pluto.","iapetus\t\t1.492000e+6\tIapetus\t\t\t\t\t\tIapetus is the outermost major moon of Saturn. It's known for its high difference in brightness between its two sides. It was formerly spelled Japetus, since the Latin language didn't differentiate between the letters I and J.","oberon\t\t1.523000e+6\tOberon\t\t\t\t\t\tOberon is the outermost and second-largest moon of Uranus. It's very similar to the slightly larger Titania, which just means I have to put more filler text. The good thing is that now I can write about filler text rather than Oberon itself.","rhea\t\t1.532800e+6\tRhea\t\t\t\t\t\tRhea is the second-largest moon of Saturn.

It is also the largest object (other than the giant planets) known to have a ring system. Its ring system, two moons, and fast rotation were likely all caused by a large impact. Impacts between objects in the Kuiper belt are rare, unlike in the asteroid belt, so Haumea may be the only one. Its fast rotation gives it an ellipsoidal shape.","great barrier\t2.300000e+6\tGreat Barrier Reef\t\t\t\tThe Great Barrier Reef is a huge coral reef near the east coast of Australia. It's very sensitive to the local climate, and so is dying very quickly. It may adapt to the changing climate, or it could die completely. There are currently attempts to save it.","eris\t\t2.326000e+6\tEris\t\t\t\t\t\tEris is the most massive and second largest known non-planet orbiting the sun. Its discovery helped confirm the existence of dwarf planets and reclassify Pluto as not being a planet. It and Pluto are still the largest known objects in the solar system after the sun and planets.","pluto\t\t2.377000e+6\tPluto\t\t\t\t\t\tPluto is the largest and second most massive known non-planet orbiting the sun. In 1845, anomalies in the orbit of Uranus were successfully used to predict and find Neptune. Later analysis found more anomalies supposedly produced by a \"Planet X\" beyond Neptune. In 1930, Pluto happened to be at the location where Planet X was predicted to be. It was later found that Pluto is about 4000 times less massive than Planet X would've been, and that the orbital anomalies were due to a slight overestimate of Neptune's mass.","hawaii\t\t2.588000e+6\tHawaii\t\t\t\t\t\tHawaii is the 50th and as of 2023 the newest U.S. state. It's made of 137 islands, only 7 of which are inhabited. The islands were formed only a few million years ago by underwater volcanism in the Pacific Ocean. The spacing between the islands is caused by the movement of the Pacific tectonic plate over Earth's mantle.","greenland\t2.684000e+6\tGreenland\t\t\t\t\tGreenland is not very green.
