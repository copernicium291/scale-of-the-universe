Since then, three more have been found: charm, bottom, and top.","alpha particle\t3.351000e-15\tAlpha Particle\t\t\t\t\tHelium-4 is the most common nucleus in the universe other than free protons. Main sequence stars use various processes to convert 4 hydrogen-1 nuclei into a helium-4 nucleus.

It quickly decays to beryllium-7.","deuteron\t4.254000e-15\tDeuteron\t\t\t\t\tMost hydrogen in the universe is hydrogen-1, which just has a proton as its nucleus. The nucleus of hydrogen-2, or deuterium, is called a deuteron and contains a neutron in addition to the proton. Because a deuterium atom has twice the mass of a hydrogen-1 atom, hydrogen-1 and hydrogen-2 are much more chemically different than isotopes of other elements are. For example, water made with deuterium freezes at 4°C (39°F) instead of 0°C (32°F).","carbon nucleus\t4.940000e-15\tCarbon Nucleus\t\t\t\t\tCarbon-12 is a very significant nuclide in the cores of stars. Once a star runs out of hydrogen, it will collapse. If it's big enough, the compression caused by the star's gravity will heat the core enough that helium nuclei can combine in groups of three to form carbon. In stars that are still fusing hydrogen (like our sun), carbon-12 can combine with four protons and release a helium nucleus, giving another way for some stars to make helium.","oxygen nucleus\t5.400000e-15\tOxygen Nucleus\t\t\t\t\tLike electrons, protons and neutrons also fill in \"shells\" in an atom. The numbers that electrons need to fill shells are 2,10,18,36,54,86,118. For protons and neutrons the numbers are 2,8,20,28,50,82,126. Nuclei with these \"magic numbers\" of protons and/or neutrons are typically much more stable than expected. The fully stable nuclei with both proton and neutron shells filled are helium-4, oxygen-16, calcium-40, calcium-48, and lead-208.","lithium-11\t6.300000e-15\tLithium-11 Nucleus\t\t\t\tThe lithium-11 nucleus has 3 protons and 8 neutrons, 4 more neutrons than the more common and stable lithium-7. It lasts for about 0.01 seconds, over 1 quintillion times longer than lithium-10 or lithium-12. This is because 2 of its neutrons are in a \"nuclear halo\". Its nucleus has a core of 3 protons and 6 neutrons, surrounded by 2 halo neutrons.","sulfur nucleus\t6.520000e-15\tSulfur Nucleus\t\t\t\t\tSulfur-32 is one of the isotopes produced by the alpha process in large stars. Carbon-12 nuclei repeatedly fuse with helium-4 nuclei until they reach nickel-56 or zinc-60. Sulfur-32 is formed by fusion of silicon-28 and helium-4. It is also produced from the fusion of two oxygen-16 nuclei.","iron nucleus\t7.480000e-15\tIron Nucleus\t\t\t\t\tIt's not actually true that the stellar fusion process ends at iron-56. Firstly, the iron actually comes from the decay of nickel-56 after the star has already exploded. Secondly, it's not even true that the fusion of nickel-56 consumes energy. Nickel-56 very commonly fuses into zinc-60, and the chain can theoretically continue for several more elements. However, the star's core is so hot that high-energy gamma rays typically destroy any nuclei heavier than nickel.","tin nucleus\t9.300000e-15\tTin Nucleus\t\t\t\t\tTin has more stable isotopes than any other element.

It's about the cross-sectional area of a uranium nucleus. It was created during the Manhattan Project to describe how likely two nuclei are to interact. Millibarns, microbars, and even smaller units are sometimes used. The lowest cross section of a successful fusion reaction was the synthesis of the element nihonium in 2004.","lead nucleus\t1.100000e-14\tLead Nucleus\t\t\t\t\tLead-208 is the heaviest atomic nucleus not known to decay.

A nucleus of unbinilium-299 (and its decay product oganesson-295) may have been detected in 2011, but it is still unknown if it was actually produced, so oganesson-294 remains the heaviest nucleus discovered for now.","super neutrino\t1.000000e-13\tSupernova Neutrino\t\t\t\tA supernova is the explosion of a massive star at the end of its life.","muonic hydrogen\t2.559277e-13\tMuonic Hydrogen Atom\t\t\t\tMuons are about 207 times heavier than electrons.

This is due to many reasons, such as being the fourth most common element in the universe, being able to form bonds with various elements in many ways, and its tendency to form long polymers.","argon atom\t1.420000e-10\tArgon Atom\t\t\t\t\tArgon is the most abundant component in Earth's air other than nitrogen and oxygen. It's been slowly created by the slight radioactivity of potassium-40 over the last 4 billion years, and now comprises about 1% of air.

It could be an antimuon, a charged pion, a lambda+ baryon, or in this case a positron, the antimatter counterpart of the electron. Unlike those other examples, positrons don't decay into other particles over time, but they do annihilate with electrons, giving positronium a short lifetime of under a millionth of a second.","silicon atom\t2.220000e-10\tSilicon Atom\t\t\t\t\tSilicon is like carbon in that its atoms typically form 4 bonds, but differs in silicon being more metallic, making silicon-based life much less likely to exist than carbon-based life.","lithium atom\t2.340000e-10\tLithium Atom\t\t\t\t\tAlkali metal atoms are very large.

The observable universe is more like the opposite of a black hole, because objects from outside can never enter.","hypersphere\t1.500000e+29\tUniverse (3-sphere, minimum)\t\t\tThe universe is currently believed to have no higher dimensional curvature. If it did have curvature, it could be shaped like a 4-dimensional \"hypersphere\". Observations have shown that if it is a hypersphere, it must be at least this big.","all dna\t\t1.700000e+29\tEarth's DNA\t\t\t\t\tEarth contains an estimated 5×10^37 base pairs of DNA. That much DNA weighs 50 million tons, and if it were piled together it would be the size of a small mountain. If you connected the ends of every strand of DNA, it would be 30 trillion light-years long.","universe 100ga\t3.000000e+29\tObservable Universe (t=100 Ga)\t\t\tThe currently-observable universe in 100 billion years. The future observable universe at that time will be very close to its maximum size of about 127 billion light-years, but the current observable universe will continue to grow indefinitely.","\t\t6.000000e+34\tPositronium Atom?\t\t\t\t","universe 1ta\t1.000000e+52\tObservable Universe (t=1 Ta)\t\t\tThis is around the time that stars will stop forming. Additionally, the universe's growth will become exponential by this time, doubling in scale every 12 billion years, and with a doubling in time approximately equivalent to squaring the scale factor.","\t\t1.000000e+90\tAll Atoms\t\t\t\t\tThe observable universe contains an estimated 10^80 atoms, each with a diameter of about 10^-10 meters. A simple division implies that lining up all the atoms of the universe would give a line 10^90 meters long.","\t\t1.000000e+43430000000\tUniverse (Inflation)\t\t\t"];
